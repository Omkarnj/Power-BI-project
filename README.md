# Power-BI-project
Power BI Visualisation project on the sales data of an international organisation.
Made dynamic and interactive charts with slicers to sort the data, and create informative templates.
Deciding which graphs and visualisations to use was a bit of a challenge here, which I figured out by studying about it more.

## Final Report of the Power BI project, More images attached below.
